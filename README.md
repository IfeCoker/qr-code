## Overview
This project is a design of a QR code. It's a first challenge of my learning of html and css. Also, the card layout doesn't shift.

### What I learned
I learnt how to impliment the use of classes in html and css:
```html
<body>
    <section class="border-box">
    <header> </header>
    <p class="one">
      Improve your front-end skills by building projects.
    </p>
    <p class="two">
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
    </p>
    </section>
  </body>
```
Got to learn to use this style property:
```css
.border-box {background-clip: border-box;}
```
